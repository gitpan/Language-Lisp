Language-Lisp version 0.20
==========================

This is perl-to-lisp bridge connection module.
Based on excellent module by Stuart Sierra, hosted at
http://stuartsierra.com/software/perl-in-lisp/
Very much thanks, Stuart! I owe you a beer.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   #(todo) make test
   #(todo) make install

Try it with
   clisp try1.lisp
   
Be sure your LISP implementation has CFFI and ASDF working.

Currently demo work only within compiled directory via 'blib'.


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires common lisp implementation(s) with CFFI.
CFFI in turn requires ASDF, see http://www.cliki.net/asdf for advices
on how to setup things working.

Unlike other Perl modules, the Lisp is started first, and then it invokes
Perl with Language::Lisp.
